Conference Paper #2 - WAPOD Testing

Abstract
=============

Wide-Area Power Oscillation Damping (WAPOD) controllers using IEEE C37.118 data have been proposed, developed and deployed in the field and are showing promise. This paper details the development, construction and implementation of a real-time, Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test set-up for such a controller. The set-up is based around the e\textsc{megasim} real-time simulator from OPAL-RT. A general purpose, phasor-based control algorithm is implemented on a Compact Reconfigurable Input/Output (cRIO) controller from National Instruments. The complete, closed-loop set-up, the hardware used and the reasons for design choices are also documented. Since this test-set-up uses IEEE C37.118 data over a TCP/IP network, the complete data path is examined. A test-case HIL test with the designed controller is also presented and the results are examined.
