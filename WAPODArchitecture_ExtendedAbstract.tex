% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure

\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/

\usepackage{float}
\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:

Wide-Area Power Oscillation Damping (WAPOD) controllers using IEEE C37.118 data have been proposed, developed and deployed in the field. This paper details the development, construction and implementation of a real-time, Hardware-in-the-loop test set-up for such a controller. The set-up is based around the e\textsc{megasim} real-time simulator from OPAL-RT. A general purpose, phasor-based control algorithm is implemented on a Compact Reconfigurable Input/Output (cRIO) controller from National Instruments. The complete, closed-loop set-up, the hardware used and the reasons for design choices are also documented. Since this test-set-up uses IEEE C37.118 data over a TCP/IP network, the complete data path is examined. A test-case HIL test with the designed controller is also presented and the results are examined.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
Instances such as the Northeast blackout of August 2003 and the August 1996 Western North America (WECC)\cite{NAERC} blackout have been significant events on large, interconnected power systems. Both can be attributed, in part, to low frequency, electromechanically induced, inter-area oscillations\cite{NAERC}. These oscillations involve the generators of one synchronous area oscillating against the generators of another area and are typically between 0.1-2Hz in frequency. The fact that these modes are poorly damped presents a danger to power systems with interconnections used for purposes such as power trading. Inter-area oscillations are also a threat to the stability of grids with significant generation coming from renewable energy sources.
%The growth of power system interconnections between previously unconnected areas has given rise to the phenomenon of inter-area oscillations. These are low frequency (0.1-2 Hz.) oscillations where the generators of one synchronous area oscillate against those of another area. Damping for these oscillations is generally poor and if they are allowed to grow, they can lead to disconnection of the ties or a collapse of the power system. A famous example of the latter was the August 1996 blackout of the WSCC system in the USA \cite{NAERC}. Although the purpose of system interconnection was to increase stability, the present situation of the power system incorporates renewable energy sources and power trading corridors, both of which impact system stability.

\subsection{Previous Experiences}
The phenomenon of intra-area oscillations is well documented and has modern solutions such as Power System Stabilisers (PSS) exist and are in use. A PSS uses locally available signals and might not be very effective at damping inter-area modes with poor local observability \cite{Yuwa}\cite{localREMcomparison}. Wide-area control systems as implemented in Norway \cite{WAPODNorway} and China \cite{WAPODChina} have extended the control system of an existing device to receive and use synchrophasor (IEEE C37.118) data.
%Modern solutions to the problem of inter-area oscillations involve using Power System Stabilisers (PSS) with locally available signals. These are effective at damping intra-area modes with good observability but may not be as effective at damping inter-area modes \cite{WAPODNorway} \cite{localREMcomparison}. Although initial field tests in \cite{WAPODNorway} \& \cite{WAPODChina} show promising results, the wide-area control systems tested so far have been implemented by extending the installed control system of an existing device (e.g. an SVC, see \cite{WAPODNorway}) to receive synchrophasor data, process it and to then feed the control algorithm. To the knowledge of the authors, there has not been any reported attempt at designing a general purpose, wire-area control system, starting from specifications and considering different hardware and software constraints. Such an approach is attractive as it can easily be adapted to different controllable elements thereby reducing implementation costs and facilitating straightforward development.
%\vspace{-0.7em}
\subsection{Contributions}
The goal of this paper is to document the details of the design and construction of a real-time test set-up for a wide-area control system.

%\"{A}ngquist and Gama's\cite{PhasorPOD} Phasor Power Oscillation (Phasor POD) algorithm was chosen based on the operational requirements and control system design constraints. The developed prototype is termed a Wide Area Power Oscillation Damper (WAPOD). For purposes of comparison, the real-time \textsc{Simulink} implementation of the Phasor POD algorithm by Almas and Vanfretti \cite{PhasorPODImplement} is used as a benchmark. The performance of the hardware prototype developed will be tested and compared to the performance of this implementation of the algorithm. The two-area four-machine model developed by Klein, Rogers and Kundur \cite{KundurTwoArea} is used as a test-case and is modified to fit the requirements of experimental testing. A Hardware-in-the-loop experiment is constructed around the e\textsc{MEGASIM} real-time simulator from OPAL-RT \cite{OPALemegasim} with the two-area model running in real-time, physical PMUs and a synchrophasor-based Phasor-POD algorithm running on a cRIO (Figure \ref{Data_path}).

%\subsection{Paper Outline}
%This paper is organised as follows. Section \ref{background} outlines the hardware and software components used together with an overview of the Phasor POD algorithm implemented. Section \ref{arch} examines the details of the architecture developed for this controller and the various stages of refinement and changes made to it. Section \ref{HILtest} presents the results of the Hardware-in-the-loop experiments performed and conclusions are drawn in Section \ref{conclusion}.

%\section{Background}\label{background}

%\subsection{Phasor POD Algorithm}
%This algorithm\cite{PhasorPOD} was selected due to its wide applicability and the fact that it does not depend on the network model or updated knowledge of the network topology. Typical model-linearisation based damping algorithms rely on computer-intensive calculations and are often valid for a particular network operating point. In contrast, the Phasor-POD algorithm only requires knowledge of the inter-area oscillation frequency, which is generally known from system studies or can be determined from synchrophasor measurements \cite{TaskForce}. Consider Equation \ref{PODEqn}, which represents a general signal $s(t)$, as an average valued component and an oscillating component.
%%The Phasor-POD algorithm was developed by \"{A}ngquist and Gama\cite{PhasorPOD} and forms the core of this work.
%\begin{equation}
%%\begin{multlined}
%s(t)={s}_{avg}+\mathrm{Re}\left\{{\stackrel{\to }{s}}_{ph}\cdot {e}^{{j}^{wt}}\right\}
%%\mbox{where, } {\stackrel{\to }{s}}_{ph} \mbox{ is a complex phasor, rotating at the frequency }\\ \omega
%\label{PODEqn}
%%\end{multlined}
%\end{equation}
%%In the two-area network used here, the inter-area oscillation frequency is known to be 0.64Hz.
%\noindent{where} $\stackrel{\to}{s}_{ph}$ is a complex phasor, rotating at the frequency $\omega$ \cite{PhasorPOD}. The Phasor-POD algorithm uses the known oscillation frequency to set up a co-orindate system rotating at this frequency and continuously extracts a phasor representing the oscillation\cite{PhasorPOD}. The implementation of the algorithm used here is based on Almas and Vanfretti's \textsc{Simulink} implementation \cite{PhasorPODImplement}. %and uses three inputs : the search frequency, $\omega_{cs1}$ and the sampling time $T_{s}$, the phase correction $alpha$ in addition to a signal scaling factor.
%
%\subsection{Hardware and Software}
%\subsubsection*{Real-Time Controller} The real-time implementation of the Phasor-POD algorithm in this work is based on the Compact Reconfigurable Input Output (cRIO) from National Instruments. The cRIO 9081 is used to implement the algorithm. It has an onboard Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) in addition to a 1.06 GHz. Intel Celeron processor for real-time control applications\cite{cRIO9081}.
%
%\subsubsection*{Phasor Measurement Units}
%The inputs to the real-time controller were taken from an IEEEC37.118-compliant synchrophasor data stream. Measurement data for this stream was generated by two PMU's which monitor three-phase currents and voltages at different points on the power network. In this work, two cRIO9076 real-time controllers \cite{cRIO9081} were deployed as PMUs\cite{PMUMario}.
%
%\subsubsection*{Real-Time Simulator}
%The e\textsc{megasim} real-time simulator from OPAL RT \cite{OPALemegasim} was used for simulating the two-area network in real-time. This simulator allowed for hardware-in-the-loop tests to be carried out using its analogue input and output terminals. Voltage and current signals were extracted from the simulator's analogue outputs and fed to amplifiers. These amplified signals were then wired to the current and voltage inputs of PMU's. Similarly, the damping signal generated by the Phasor-POD algorithm was wired back to the simulator's analogue input terminals for use in the simulation. Figure \ref{Data_path} presents the entire signal path including the external, closed-loop controller.
%
%\subsubsection*{Software}
%The test-case network model used here was a version of the Klein-Rogers-Kundur two-area system implemented in a \textsc{Simulink} demo available with SimPowerSystems\cite{SIMULINKOnline}. This was modified to include an average-valued SVC model, identical to that used in \cite{PhasorPODImplement}. The software on the cRIO was written using LabView's Real-Time modules. Software development was done on a workstation computer. Code was loaded on the various devices (cRIO contollers, RT Simulator) over a TCP network.

%The approach broadly includes the four steps from \cite{WaterfallCoding} 
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Initial Investigation
%\item Requirements Definition
%\item Architecture Design
%\item Coding and Implementation
%\item Experimental Testing to validate requirements
%\end{enumerate}


\section{Architecture Development Process}\label{arch}

The software development approach followed here is based on the Waterfall method detailed in \cite{WaterfallCoding}. The linear waterfall method was modified to be iterative to account for various constraints and to also account for revisions in the initial definition caused by these constraints. This iterative process is illustrated in Figure \ref{Reference}, sub-figure 1 and is realised for the specific application here, as illustrated in Figure \ref{Reference}, sub-figure~2. %Several reasons were behind the choice of an iterative design approach. Chief among them was the cRIO hardware itself. As an implementation on this hardware had not been attempted earlier, the limitations of the hardware were unknown. Based on the limitations faced during an implementation attempt, the design and features incorporated would be revised to fit within the limitations of the hardware. 
\begin{figure*}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{DelaySources.pdf} 
\caption{Data path in HIL test. Hardware used is indicated in {\color{red}red} text.}
\label{Revision1}
\end{figure*}
\subsection{Constraints}
%
%Before defining requirements, the possible constraints at each stage of the test set-up were considered. The test set-up shown in Figure \ref{Data_path} is used to illustrate the constraints faced.
%
%\subsubsection*{Differing Loop Rates}
%The power system simulation running on the real-time simulator was run at a loop rate of 50$\mu$s. This meant that the simulator generated new values for currents and voltages every 50$\mu$s. and would also expect data from the HIL system every 50$\mu$s. The constraint here was the data reporting rate of the PMU's used which was a maximum of 50 samples per second or one sample every 20ms. This was much slower that the 50$\mu$s. loop rate of the real-time simulator. 
%\subsubsection*{FPGA Accuracy}
%While the exact role of the FPGA in this implementation was not known in advance, it brought with it some limitations. Chief among these was the limitation on data accuracy due to the fact that all calculations together with circuit logic would be implemented in hardware.
%\vspace{-1em}
\section{Architecture Implementation and Refinement}
Figure \ref{Reference}, sub-figure 1 shows the three-stage design process with design proposal, implementation and revision. To begin with, the controller specifications were used to draft a design proposal. An implementation attempt was made using this draft proposal. When the additional limits imposed by the software and hardware platforms were included, some goals of the original implementation needed to be revised. With these limitations, the original design was modified to generate a revised design. An attempt was then made to implement this revised design. As further limitations were encountered, the design was further modified. This iterative process was repeated till a working implementation was reached.

\subsubsection{Initial Design Proposal}
Initially, an autonomous, independent controller was envisaged. Such a controller would be able to receive IEEE C37.118 synchrophasor data directly over the communication network and extract measurement data (Figure \ref{Reference}, sub-figure 2). This design also incorporated two control functions, a wide area control function and a local control function. The wide area control function was the Phasor POD\cite{PhasorPOD}. The local control function would use locally available data in a manner similar to a Power System Stabiliser (PSS). Automatic switching between the two functions and automated input signal selection was also considered. If the signal to noise ratio in the wide area signal deteriorated or if the signal delay became prohibitively high, the controller would automatically switch to the local signal or another wide-area signal. The principal consideration in this design was the limited resources available on the FPGA and the complexity of the algorithms to be implemented. This required implementation of all algorithms and computation sections on the RT section of the cRIO with the FPGA being used for interpolation only. %In addition, the RT controller chosen has tremendous flexibility as algorithms are implemented using software, rather than hardware as on the FPGA. The RT controller also has more storage space available to implement algorithms. %This design would be able to compute observability indices for the different input signals and then automatically select the one with the highest observability of a particular mode

%\begin{figure}[!b]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{Revision.png} 
%\caption{Iterative Revision Flow Diagram}
%\label{Revision1}
%\end{figure}

%\subsubsection*{Challenges} This design was faced with a problem of differing loop rates. The real-time simulator runs at a 50$\mu$s time step. The fastest that the RT controller could run was 1ms. Data would thus be generated faster than the RT controller was able to process. The second problem was producing control output at the rate expected by the real-time simulator. The speed constraint of the RT controller meant that it would not be possible to use it to generate a control signal. To address this issue, this architecture envisaged using the FPGA to perform interpolation between successive data points. Data generated by the FPGA would be sent over the communication network back to the real-time simulator for use in the simulation. This design needed to be changed due to limitations of different components. 
%The RT controller on the cRIO is not capable of matching this speed.
%\begin{figure}[H]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{InitialArch}
%\vspace{-0.5em}
%\caption{Initial Software Architecture}
%\label{fig:InitialArch}
%\end{figure}

%One, no software was available to receive a synchrophasor stream and extract measurement data directly on the RT controller. This process had to be performed on a desktop computer running a real-time data mediator (Statnett's Synchrophasor Software Development Toolkit, $S^{3}DK$ \cite{SDK}) and LabVIEW. Once measurement data from the synchrophasor stream was available, it could be streamed to the real-time controller over the TCP/IP network using LabView's Shared Network Variables. Two, data generated by the FPGA could not be sent to the real-time simulator directly over the communication network. Though theoretically possible, further work is required. Also, synchronising the process of generating the control signal and the use of the generated data on the real-time simulator is a complex task. Three, the process of data interpolation on the FPGA is computationally intensive. To achieve results better than with a simple linear interpolation, a history of past data points is required. This process is, in itself, complex and introduces further delay. It is, however, simpler than implementing the damping control algorithm on the FPGA. At this stage, FPGA limitations were the principal factor behind choosing to implement the Phasor-POD algorithm on the RT controller. Four, an algorithm for automated signal selection based on observability indices had not been developed. In principle, this too, is possible and can be implemented on the real-time controller in the future when such an algorithm is developed and verified. The Phasor POD algorithm input parameters also change depending on the input used. An approach to determine these parameters iteratively or calculate them from input data is required. %This only adds to the complexity.

\subsubsection{Development and Revision}
%\begin{figure}[h]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{Revision.png}
%\vspace{-0.5em}
%\caption{Revised Architecture}
%\label{fig:Revision}
%\end{figure}

With the limitations of the initial architecture in mind, the architecture was refined. The process of  extracting data from the synchrophasor stream was shifted to a workstation computer along with the processes of signal selection and processing. Once data was available, it was sent to the RT controller, over the  network. The damping control was kept on the RT controller with the FPGA performing the interpolation required to match the read-interval of the real-time simulator. Besides the damping control algorithm, a local control function was included on the RT controller. This revision is shown in Figure \ref{Reference}, sub-figure 3. Here, the complexity of implementing an interpolation algorithm on the FPGA was examined in detail. An implementation was also attempted. It was determined that a simple linear interpolation algorithm would not be sufficiently accurate. An implementation of the damping control algorithm on the RT controller was also tested. The fastest loop rate that could be achieved was always in excess of 25ms. This was slower than the reporting rate of the PMUs. Communication between the cRIO and the RT simulator using TCP/IP was also abandoned. Analogue output signals of the FPGA were instead hard-wired to the real-time simulator's analogue inputs.
\subsubsection{Final Implementation}

%Further, the FPGA output was limited by the speed of the RT controller.

At this stage, the damping control algorithm was moved to the FPGA with the RT controller being used only for network communication and data monitoring. The  Phasor POD algorithm parameters and monitoring data would be sent over the network to the RT section of the controller. The local control function was also discarded. The desired 50$\mu$s. data output rate could also be maintained as the FPGA was capable of response times of this order. The problem of differing data and loop rates was solved by implementing a basic sample-and-hold algorithm on the FPGA. With the Phasor POD algorithm implemented on the FPGA, resource utilization stood at 78\%. As with the previous design, the process of extracting data from the synchrophasor stream was done on a workstation computer. This (Figure \ref{Reference}) was the final architecture as implemented. %An outline of the FPGA code as implemented are shown in Figure \ref{FPGA_Blocks}.

A setup identical to that outlined in Figure \ref{Data_path} was constructed and used to verify the working of the hardware WAPOD. %The signal generated from the real-time Phasor POD implementation is reinserted in the model at the control system of the SVC in the two-area network.
The hardware implementation of the POD algorithm was verified to be able to keep the system stable in steady state. It was also tested with small perturbations applied at one generator to excite the inter-area mode and was verified to work satisfactorily. Figure \ref{Results} shows the performance of the controller with two different inputs,active power and voltage angle difference. It is immediately evident that using the voltage angle difference provides better performance. %The damping signal generated by the hardware controller was captured on an oscilloscope and is presented in Figure \ref{ScopeCapture}.

%\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
%A hardware prototype of a real-time power oscillation damping control system was developed and tested. The developed prototype uses a real-time implementation of a wide-area control system. Issues and challenges faced in this implementation are documented and examined. The architecture development \& refinement process for this implementation is also examined in detail. The success of the tests performed indicates that PMU-based wide area controllers can be exploited for multiple control applications in power system control and monitoring.
